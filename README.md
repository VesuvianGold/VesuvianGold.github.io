## Thanks to Empress Xania

How long has she been gone!?! Ain't no sunhsine folks. 

### Whereupon

I, too, found myself aloft wild tempest in the wee hours, whereupon I'd discovered a bewilderment of follies and mystery - upon the dumbwaiter, in the purple receptacle for which yon master chef's vials, flasks and carafes are placed for the incendiary, KINDLE, some undulated in it's original adornment, prepped for fire but born, nay stolen, from the master's library. A betrayal no less from the queen's wispy machinations to ruin her beloved's trove of knowledge and wealth of wise artisans and scribes.

### The Meg

So, I rate a president based off of favorables across party lines and longevity of their influence post-presidency. So, in trying to determine which party actually fits most people based on the reports and discussions I've had, I think these statements best represent the overall.

* some abortions are necessary * legal immigration could be safer and easier * voting is a right and should be easier / politicians shouldn't be bought * kids should be aware of a spiritual and moral importance to their choices * we should defend our country and help weaker countries when possible *we should have balance with nature when it comes to pollution and endangered animals * law and order should consider human rights and how it fits protect and serve * we should spend money wisely on military needs * addiction clinics would help more than drug criminalization * employers and government shouldn't discriminate * government should cover healthcare for those that can't afford it and are truly at-risk but most should buy their own plans that fit them most * the wealthy should pay most taxes but not so much that it's not competitive * we should try other energy sources than coal * we should cut taxes and regulation * people should have a say in how their retirement funds are invested * parents should have some say in education for children * guns are a right but not everyone is ok to have a gun * we should have fair trade so we aren't losing so many jobs * we should think of our needs as Americans before the UN.

D&C 121

41 No power or influence can or ought to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood, only by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned;

42 By kindness, and pure knowledge, which shall greatly enlarge the soul without hypocrisy, and without guileâ€”

43 Reproving betimes with sharpness, when moved upon by the Holy Ghost; and then showing forth afterwards an increase of love toward him whom thou hast reproved, lest he esteem thee to be his enemy;

44 That he may know that thy faithfulness is stronger than the cords of death.

45 Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven.

46 The Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion, and thy scepter an unchanging scepter of righteousness and truth; and thy dominion shall be an everlasting dominion, and without compulsory means it shall flow unto thee forever and ever.
